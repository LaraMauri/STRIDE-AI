|ML model asset|Failure mode|
|:---|:---|
|**_Hyper-parameters_** are meta parameters associated with any ML algorithm that do not have dependency on the data, and whose value is set before the learning process begins. Their value can defined by trial-and-error using model space search techniques.|Hyper-parameters may fail when no hyper-parameter optimization is performed. Relying on the model’s default hyper-parameters implies that their value may be completely inappropriate for the underlying problem.|
|**_Model parameters_** are variables that are internal to the model and whose value can be estimated by fitting the given data to the model.|Model parameters are affected by hyper-parameter tuning. Thus, they fail when the choice of the provided hyper-parameters is not right, resulting in poor performance of the ML model.|
|**_Data pre-processing algorithms_** are techniques employed to improve information quality by cleaning, integrating and transforming data, resulting in improved ML model’s performance.|Data pre-processing algorithms may fail when inconsistencies in the use of modeling methodologies result in flaws or defects of the data and metadata schemata.|
|**_Trained models_** are models whose internal parameters have been adjusted by training to achieve a minimum of the error function that defines the distance between the actual and the expected outputs.|Trained models fail when the discrepancy between data seen during the learning process and inference cause a drop in performance in production.|
|**_Deployed models_** are models whose learned state is assumed not to change anymore, and to which consumers can submit queries and receive outputs.|Deployed models may fail when the AI-based system degrades because it operates under adversarially corrupted data or due to system crashes and loss of network connectivity.|
